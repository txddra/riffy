__Imagine__ being able to convert :
- Centimeters to inches
- Inches to centimeters
- Inches to feet
- Feet to inches 

and our newest feature(s) :
- Miles to Kilometers!
  
&
- Kilometers to Centimeters!

*In the same amount of time that it would probably take to do a google search, but hey, we're already here :D*

# Steps:
  **Ask yourself**:
- *"what unit of measure do I feel like converting from?"*
- *"what unit of measure do I feel like converting to?"*
- *"why is my country so afraid of the metric system?"*
- *"...did I leave the oven on?*

**Once you've ran through that series of questions you're ready to use the app**

1. input a number, signifying the value that you are going to converting from, and a unit of measure (in/cm/ft/km/mi, etc.)
   
2.  receive the conversion
   
3.  **Celebrate!**


** please note that if you do not enter a value, you will receive a error message.

## Happy Converting!
